= Version 1.8.5
 * osdeps: the apt-dpkg was interpreting removed-but-not-purged as installed.
   Fix.
 * osdeps: fix autoproj osdeps --show

= Version 1.8.4
 * fix wrong order for application of overrides.rb (was: most specific to more
   general).

= Version 1.8.3
 * fix broken env.sh when amake <package> or aup <package> are called

= Version 1.8.0
 * fix issues with 1.9.3
 * significantly refactor the osdeps handling. It should make the addition of
   other OS-independent handlers (along rubygems) easier. Moreover, it is now
   possible to specify gem dependency on a per-OS basis (was always global
   before) 
 * the autoproj command line learned the -p option to control parallelism (i.e.
   -p1 forces to use only one process)

= Version 1.7.20
 * do not generate an error if an unknown package is used as an optional
   dependency. The rationale is that one can then have optional features that
   are only present if other package sets are included (as e.g. the presence or
   not of RTT as a package, i.e. the rock.toolchain package set)

= Version 1.7.19
 * use different colors for remote-only and local-only commits in autoproj
   status
 * fix some issues with handling of osdeps vs. exclusion/ignore handling
 * fix handling of optional dependencies that are provided by osdeps

= Version 1.7.18
 * properly detect and report circular dependencies

= Version 1.7.17
 * fix some return values in PackageManifest as REXML#text returns nil if no
   text element is present while nokogiri was returning an empty string
 * create autoproj clean

= Version 1.7.16
 * when a manifest.xml is invalid, make sure that the error message pinpoints
   which package it concerns (mainly for proper reporting in build servers)
 * stop displaying configuration after bootstrap. It's a lot of text and cannot
   be read until you know what you are looking for
 * setup Autobuild.color to follow the --no-color option

= Version 1.7.15
 * remove dependency on nokogiri. This is the first step in an effort to make
   autoproj as straightforward to bootstrap as possible.
 * gracefully handle multiple autoproj instances trying to access the OS
   packaging system concurrently. A message is now issued that one has to wait
   for the other to finish. This is critical for build servers.
 * allow conditional loading of osdeps file. The system works by adding suffixes
   to Autoproj::OSDependencies.suffixes which tune what files to load. As an
   example, autoproj's handling of Ruby adds either the ruby18 or ruby19 suffix,
   which leads to either loading

     file.osdeps-ruby18

   or

     file.osdeps-ruby19

   after a file.osdeps "normal" file gets loaded. It will allow in the long run
   to use OS packages in version-dependent setup (i.e. different packages for
   ruby 1.8 and 1.9 for instance)
 * fix the auto-add feature
 * add the --no-color option for non-console outputs (think build servers)
 * splitted the "Build failed: reason" line into two lines to allow extraction
   by Jenkins

= Version 1.7.14
 * fix support for local package sets, i.e. package sets that are saved in
   autoproj/directory_name and are part of the main configuration VCS.
 * fix behavior of autoproj when adding a remote package set in
   autoproj/manifest and calling amake my/package right away. Until now,
   autoproj was yelling with a criptic message. It will now behave and check out
   the new package set.
 * add support for sourcing shell scripts from env.sh:
   Autoproj.env_source_file(path)
 * fix a Ruby 1.9 incompatibility
 * better performance in e.g. autoproj query and autoproj locate (this speeds up
   acd)
 * accept amake --rebuild the same way than amake --force was accepted until now
 * add support for including manifest.xml files in the package sets. This is
   meant to be used for external packages that do not provide a manifest.
   The manifests are listed in the package set's manifests/ subdirectory and
   must match the package name, as e.g.
      rock.git/external/yaml-cpp.xml
   The package set's manifest takes precedence over the package one.
 * added the --exit-code option to autoproj status. It is meant to be used
   in scripts to check whether autoproj update will modify the source code
   (for instance, in build servers)
 * removed explicit installation of rdoc to fix issues with RubyGems 1.7.x.
   Additionally, the Gems documentation is not generated by default anymore as
   most people don't need it. It can be reenabled with
     Autoproj::OSDependencies.gem_doc = true
 * be compatible with (soon-to-be-removed) deprecations in RubyGems 1.8.x
 * allow usage of metapackages in the dependency tracking (i.e. one can use a
   metapackage as a dependency of another package now)

= Version 1.7.13
 * bugfix release: fix HTTP fallback mechanism for gitorious servers

= Version 1.7.12
 * improved some error messages
 * fixed error if config.yml is empty
 * fixed issues with implicitly selecting ignored or excluded packages on the
   command line
 * fixed handling of overrides that change the VCS type
   If a package 'A' is normally under git and has an explicit branch, as e.g.
     
     - test:
        type: git
        url: my/url.git
        branch: master

   Then an override of

     - test:
        type: archive
        url: http://other/url.tar.bz2

   would fail as the 'branch' git option was passed to the archive importer.
   This is handled well now.
 * added metapackage support. One can now "group" packages under a certain name,
   said name being used in the manifest' layout, exclude_packgaes and/or
   ignore_packages.

   This is used in the autobuild files with

      metapackage 'name', 'package1', 'package2', ...

   The "default" metapackage, i.e. the list of packages that are selected when a
   package set name is used in layout/exclude/ignore, can also be configured
   with

      default_packages 'package1', 'package2', ...

   When a package set 'pkg_set' is created, two metapackages are created:

     pkg_set
     pkg_set.all

   The first one is configurable with default_packages, while the second one
   always lists all packages directly defined in pkg_set

 * added support for custom source handlers. Custom source handlers are a way to
   declare shortcuts for importers.

   For instance,
   
     Autoproj.gitorious_server_configuration('SPACEGIT', 'spacegit.dfki.uni-bremen.de')

   defines a special 'spacegit' handler, and one can now do, in its source.yml,

     version_control:
        - my/package:
          spacegit: imoby/scripts

   The version control is then transparently expanded by autoproj to

        - my/package:
          type: git
          url: git://spacegit.dfki.uni-bremen.de/imoby/scripts.git
          push_to: git@spacegit.dfki.uni-bremen.de:imoby/scripts.git

   These custom handlers can be used everywhere a version control specification
   is required. They can be defined with Autoproj.add_source_handler (see the
   API documentation)

 * fix CVS support. This requires autobuild >= 1.5.42. The syntax in source.yml
   is

      type: cvs
      url: <URL of the CVSROOT>
      module: module_name
      cvsup: ['options', 'for', 'cvsup']
      cvsco: ['options', 'for', 'cvsco']

   The default options for cvs up and cvs co are resp. -dP and -d.

= Version 1.7.11
 * loads of fixes related to ignore_packages
   - fix ignored packages being built if a package depends on them
   - allow whole package sets to be ignored
   - make setup_package(package_name) { |pkg| ... } ignore the block if the
     package is ignored
 * really fix ignoring osdeps dependencies completely (thought to be working in
   1.7.9). The following syntax is now accepted in osdeps files:

    ruby: ignore

 * add the 'nonexistent' keyword in osdeps files. In combination with the
   default target, it makes it easier to add new osdeps packages. For instance,
   the following snippet will cause anyone trying to get libnl2-dev to fail on
   older ubuntu versions:

    libnl2:
       debian: libnl2-dev
       ubuntu:
         '10.04,10.10': nonexistent
         default: libnl2-dev

 * add more fine-grained control over the osdeps/source packages relationships.
   Until now, we had a fallback mechanism in which nonexistent osdeps would be
   replaced by source packages with the same name.

   The replacement packages can now be specified (they don't have to have the
   same name) with

     Autoproj.add_osdeps_overrides 'opencv', :packages => ['external/opencv']

   Moreover, if one wants to make sure that the source package is taken instead
   of the osdeps one regardless of everything else, he can do

     Autoproj.add_osdeps_overrides 'opencv', :packages => ['external/opencv'], :force => true

 * small API addition and fixes

= Version 1.7.10
 * really fix support of virtual packages on dpkg-based systems (debian, ubuntu)
   1.7.9 was only supporting packages that were providing only one package
  
= Version 1.7.9
 * improve ruby 1.9 compatibility
 * fix ignoring osdeps dependencies completely, i.e.
    ruby: ignore
   is now working fine (before, one had to provide at least an OS name)
 * on dpkg-based systems (debian, ubuntu), fix detection of installed virtual packages
 * fix passing autoproj options from aup and amake to autoproj itself (it was
   broken). One can now *really* do
     amake --no-deps
   as advertised by the 1.7.8 release notes.
 * autoproj_bootstrap now follows the AUTOPROJ_DEFAULT_OSDEPS environment
   variable

= Version 1.7.8
 * fix bootstrap and switch-config with VCS options (i.e. setting a branch on
   the git importer)
 * amake now accepts options, i.e.
   amake . --no-deps will only build the current package (without looking at
   dependencies)
 * added aup, which is a shortcut for autoproj update
   as for amake, aup without arguments will update the package in which it is
   started

= Version 1.7.7
 * quickfix a trivial bug

= Version 1.7.6
 * ship the generic configuration of gitorious
   server from Rock. It defines
     Autoproj.gitorious_server_configuration
   (see autoproj's API documentation)

= Version 1.7.5
 * quickfix release
 * fix osdeps_mode issue on bootstrapping
 * ignore osdeps-related errors in modes
   where the osdeps should not be managed
   by autoproj at all.
 * fix expansion of array elements in source.yml
 * finally got a way to have amake work. The
   RubyGem packaging had replaced the executable
   by a RubyGem wrapper, assuming it was a ruby
   file (but it was a shell script)

= Version 1.7.4
 * add amake to the gem (forgot it in 1.7.3)
 * fix some corner-cases in osdeps handling
 * fix autoproj build <builddir> when <builddir> is
   not the root of a package
 * make autoproj build <builddir> (and amake <builddir>)
   auto-add the package if it is not registered in
   the current build configuration
 * the --no-deps option allows to do operations without
   taking the dependencies into account (for instance,
   update or build a single package)
 * allow version specifications for gems in the osdeps
   files, e.g.
     
     hoe:
       gem: "hoe < 1.9.0"

 * add the required_autoproj_version field in source.yml
   to require a specific autoproj version

= Version 1.7.3
== For basic usage
 * amake is a command that is a shortcut to "autoproj
   build". I.e.  amake .  will build the package in the
   current directory and all its dependencies
 * added tag support. The manifest and the autobuild
   files allow to add textual tags to packages, that
   will be picked up by documentation later on.
   Moreover, some tags can be used to tune the build.
   For instance, rock uses the 'stable' tag to set the
   CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE variable on cmake packages to
   either Debug (non-stable) or RelWithDebInfo
   (stable).

== For advanced usage
 * support ignoring/excluding OS packages
 * define Package#post_import which allows to run a
   code block after the package has been imported, but
   before the build. The global
     Autoproj.post_import do |pkg|
     end
   allows to do it for all defined packages.
 * define Package#remove_obsolete_installed_file(*path)
   which allows to remove files from the installation
   directory. Useful for simple upgrade cases, when
   files move from one package to another
 * in source.yml, a package name is interpreted as a
   regular expression only if it contains
   non-alphanumeric characters. This avoids some
   surprising effects if the name of package BlaBla is
   a subset of the package BlaBlaBlo

= Version 1.7.2
== Quickfix release
 * fix layouts that use subdirectories
 * load overrides.rb being loaded *before* the optiona dependencies are resolved

= Version 1.7.1
== Quickfix release
 * autoproj update was not installing osdeps even if the osdeps mode was not
   'none'
 * fix autolocate (and therefore acd) in configurations that use not_on and
   only_on

= Version 1.7.0
== For basic use
 * removed some OS dependency updates that should not be there. In
   practice, it means that build and fast-build will generally be a
   lot faster
 * The shell function "acd", akin to rosbuild's roscd, is also
   provided for recognized shells (bash and zsh at the moment). The
   relevant files are sourced in env.sh if the user's shell is
   compatible
   See http://rock-robotics.org/quick_start.html#shell_helpers
 * added an easier way to add a local checked-out package to a build
   without going through editing 20 files. Packages are automatically
   detected and added to the build as soon as their path, relative to
   the root dir, are explicitely listed in autoproj/manifest.
   See http://rock-robotics.org/autoproj/autoproj/adding_packages.html
 * added the --stats option that displays timing statistics about the
   build.  Raw statistics are always saved in install/log/stats.log
== For advanced use
 * introduced cross-package-set imports. A package set can now tell
   autoproj to install another one in a recursive manner
   See http://rock-robotics.org/autoproj/advanced/cross_set_dependencies.html
 * added optional dependencies, which will not be considered if the
   depended- upon package is either not existing or is explicitely
   excluded from the build.
   See http://rock-robotics.org/autoproj/advanced/package_dependencies.html
 * added the #package toplevel method to get a package handle, i.e.
       package('orocos/rtt')
   is equivalent to the former
       Autobuild::Package['orocos/rtt']
 * added tools to test the build configuration on build servers.
   - the --randomize-layout option which makes autoproj build each
     package in a separate non-trivial subfolder, and install it in a
     separate folder as well. This is meant to test the definition and
     handling of dependencies between the different packages.
   - the autoproj_stress_test script clears the layout and adds
     packages one by one in a random order, testing at each step if
     the resulting configuration works fine. It turns on
     --randomize-layout as well.
 * "acd" is using the autolocate tool, which returns the full path to
   a certain package.
   
= Version 1.6.2
 * overhauled osdeps fine-grained configuration. See
   http://rock-robotics.org/autoproj/osdeps.html
   for more information
 * fix too-aggressive caching of operating system characteristics,
   which breaks on OS upgrades.
 * on Debian-like systems, filter out packages that are already
   installed
 * on all systems, filter packages that have already been handled by
   the osdeps
 * add a -k option that continues operation even after errors. The sum
   of all errors are properly presented at the end of the run.
 * when boostrapping, check that the current directory is empty and
   warn the user if it is not.
 * a few more minor bugfixes

= Version 1.6.1
 * fix a limitation of giving directories on the command line. Before, only
   packages that were explicitely listed in the layout would be selected. Now,
   all packages are looked for -- even
 * fix Fedora and other flavors of Linux being (wrongly) detected as supported
   OSes
 * fix answering 'wait' at bootstrap time. This was rejected later on.

= Version 1.6.0
 * starting this version, autoproj becomes the official build system for the
   Orocos Toolchain project
 * the osdeps management is now configurable: one can request autoproj to not
   install osdeps, to ask each time and/or to simply wait when osdeps should
   be installed
 * autoproj stops bailing out on OSes that it does not know. It simply does
   not offer to install OS dependencies on these operating systems
 * quite a few small bugfixes

= Version 1.5.8
 * add a way to add some ignore regexp to the dependency tracking. Updated user
   guide about that.
 * small cosmetic fixes
 * warn if an osdeps file overrides information present in other osdeps files
 * performance improvement at initialization: we now cache the result of OS
   autodetection in config.yml. That removes a few seconds due to calling
   lsb_release
 * better error reporting in some cases related to OS dependencies

= Version 1.5.7
 * allow using options and constants in the manifest as well
   This is so that we can use variables in the VCS definition for package sets.
 * display a status message before we access the RubyGems server. Ruby may block
   there in some cases, and it therefore gives a clue at what is actually
   failing.
 * fix autoproj status with remote sources: display the source name instead of
   the URL
 * fix symlink in autoproj/remotes after a checkout. The URL was used instead of
   the source name. Further updates were fixing it.

= Version 1.5.6
 * quickfix stupid bug in 1.5.5

= Version 1.5.5
 * allow to exclude some packages on some architectures

   Autobuild files can now contain 
     not_on 'os_name1', 'os_name2' do
       ...
     end
   statements that will exclude any package defined in
   the do ... end block if the OS is listed in the OS
   names

   os_name is either a plain string, in which case it has to be the main
   operating system name (e.g. 'unbuntu', 'debian', ...) or a [name, version]
   array.

   For instance:

     not_on 'ubuntu', ['debian', 'squeeze'] do
       cmake_package 'not_on_ubuntu_and_debian_testing'
     end

   If the user tries to build one of the disabled packages, he will get a proper
   error message.

 * Debian unstable is now recognized by 'sid' and/or 'unstable'. It previously
   had to be called 'squeeze/sid' (for the current unstable)

= Version 1.5.4
 * better error message when a dependency does not exist

= Version 1.5.3
 * use osdeps-provided packages instead of autobuild-built ones even if they are
   implicitely selected in the layout (i.e. because of a package set name).
 * allow to force using the autobuild-built package instead of the OSdeps
   provided one by explicitely listing the package name in the layout.
 * fix multiple loading of manifests (harmless, but annoying)
 * added an 'overrides' section in source.yml, and made the version_control
   field local to the given package set. This is because there is too much
   possibility for name clashes when people start sharing package sets, and it
   allows to simply change some of the VCS parameters (most often, the branch)
   without having to redefine the complete configuration.
 * packages defined in the local source do not need to have an entry in
   overrides.yml anymore. Only proper package sets do.
 * fix env.sh update in cases of build failures
 * fix osdeps/autobuild package unification in some cases. In particular,
   autoproj will fall-back to self-built packages if an OS package is not
   provided on *this particular OS/version pair*, even though it exists for
   other OSes or other versions of the same OS.
 * in case the layout selects some packages, partial build commands should not
   forcefully select packages that are not part of the layout at all.
 * add the ability to override the default.osdeps file by setting
   AUTOPROJ_DEFAULT_OSDEPS environment variable

= Version 1.5.2
 * fix ignored_packages and exclude_packages

= Version 1.5.1
 * --no-osdeps disables updating autobuild and autoproj, as it should
 * fixed checking out modules that are not yet checked out
 
= Version 1.5.0
 * the "clean up this  mess" release. Autoproj's main logic is now properly
   split into separate methods instead of being all in a monolitic bin/autoproj
 * autoproj build does not update by default anymore. This was a behaviour
   change that was requested by quite a few users.
 * OS dependencies and normal dependencies are unified. An OS dependency will
   have priority, if one is available on the OS. Otherwise, an autoproj package
   will be searched for.
 * remote package sets have become first-class citizens. The package sets are
   still checked out in .remotes/WEIRD_NAME, but they are then symlinked to
   autoproj/remotes/package_set_name for manipulation and inspection.
 * a lot of fixes related to partial builds and partial package selections
 * fixed wrong generation of env.sh files in some cases (mostly related to
   partial builds)

= Version 1.4.4
 * really fix the bug mentioned in 1.4.3

= Version 1.4.3
 * quickfix installations that have no layouts

= Version 1.4.2
 * change the order in which package sets are considered for version control
   information in the manifest. The package set list needs now to be defined
   from the most generic to the least generic
 * define a shell script called 'ruby' in prefix/bin to call the right ruby
   interpreter. This makes the "#! /usr/bin/env ruby" she-bang line working
   on interpreters that are not called 'ruby'.
 * the package directories (prefix, srcdir, builddir, ...) can be used by other
   packages for their configuration now.

= Version 1.4.1
 * add the envsh build mode: only update env.sh
 * rebuild <package> and force-build <package> only apply by default on the
   selected packages, not on their dependencies
 * fix rebuild for Ruby packages

= Version 1.4.0
 * ruby 1.9 compatible
 * fixes w.r.t. running autoproj under a Ruby interpreter that is not called
   'ruby' (as ruby1.9.1 on Debian)
 * packages that os-depend on 'ruby' will now depend on either ruby18 or ruby19,
   depending on the ruby version used.
 * add Arch-Linux support
 * fixes w.r.t. the 'doc' mode. In particular, the documentation installation
   now follows the layout.
 * some cosmetic fixes

= Version 1.3.4
 * Improve the RubyGems support
   - a given osdeps name can refer to a mixture of RubyGems and OS packages
   - the osdeps name can be different from the RubyGems package name
 * Fix: Autobuild::Package#depends_on_os_package(name) was not taken into
   account
 * Fix: the autoproj/ directory was deleted if "autoproj switch-config" fails.
   Fix that for the common case. It can still happen if the VCS is not
   accessible.

= Version 1.3.3
 * Fix: some configuration options were not properly saved
 * Fix: env.sh was messed up by partial builds (builds where a directory and/or
   package name is specified)
 * Fix: accept subdirectories of packages as argument to builds

= Version 1.3.2
 * Fix: GEM_HOME/bin was not added to env.sh

= Version 1.3.1
 * quick-fix bootstrapping from a git repository, and the switch-config
   command

= Version 1.3.0
 * Fix limitations of using layouts. autoproj is now able to find out
   cross-layout dependencies and act accordingly.
 
= Version 1.2.6
 * Fix mail reporting

= Version 1.2.5
 * Quickfix release: fix "autoproj bootstrap VCS URL"

= Version 1.2.4
 * manage LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 * only include the values relevant to our packages in the generated env.sh,
   instead of overcrowding them with inherited values.

= Version 1.2.3
 * fix the definition of the subversion package under ubuntu/debian
 * improve selection of packages on the command line. Most glitches
   that appears when using that feature are gone now.
 * allow to give options to the VCS during boostrap, and to switch
   the source of the configuration. I.e.
     autoproj switch-config git URL branch=newbranch
   will exchange/update the configuration in autoproj/ with the specified one.
 * bugfixes

= Version 1.2.2
 * added support for Gentoo
 * added support for Ubuntu 9.10 [Karmic Koala]
 * add the 'fast-build' mode which is equivalent to 
   "build --no-update --no-osdeps"
 * add a quick bootstrap method [still experimental]
   If an autoproj installation is already present, one can simply run autoproj
   bootstrap [options]. It speeds up the bootstrapping as the gems are taken
   from the other installation.
 * minor bugfixes and improvements

= Version 1.2.1
 * accept two layouts for version control description:
   
   - package_name:
       type: git
       url: blablabla

   and

   - package_name:
     type: git
     url: blablabla

   Even though the second one is not the proper YAML data structure,
   it is actually quite intuitively written by humans, so accept it.

= Version 1.2.0
 * added the rebuild and force-build modes
 * added a local source that allows to override imported package sets and so on.
 * improved documentation on the subject of customizing the installation

= Version 1.1.3
 * fix --reconfigure on installations where the main configuration is managed by
   a VCS
 * fix: env.sh where updated on "status" or "doc", which made them invalid
 * shut up the "lsb_release: command not found" message during bootstrapping
 * fix restartig the autoproj_bootstrap script after a failed attempt

= Version 1.1.2
 * fix version detection on Debian, lsb-release cannot be trusted there.
 * update already installed Gem
 * make autoproj update himself, as well as autobuild

= Version 1.1.1
 * better general error reporting
 * small fixes w.r.t. bootstrapping
 * small improvements in the handling of layouts
 * make it easier to write osdeps scripts: the OS names and version accept lists
   as for instance:
     debian,ubuntu:
       lenny,9.04: package_to_install
 * detect Ubuntu

= Version 1.1.0
 * added some sanity checks, especially w.r.t. an already existing GEM
   installation
 * improved the bootstrap
 * autoproj is now able to track a configuration repository (i.e. a VCS that
   stores both the installation's manifest and the package sets)

= Version 1.0
 * initial release
