= Version 1.5.3
 * use osdeps-provided packages instead of autobuild-built ones even if they are
   implicitely selected in the layout (i.e. because of a package set name).
 * allow to force using the autobuild-built package instead of the OSdeps
   provided one by explicitely listing the package name in the layout.
 * fix multiple loading of manifests (harmless, but annoying)
 * added an 'overrides' section in source.yml, and made the version_control
   field local to the given package set. This is because there is too much
   possibility for name clashes when people start sharing package sets, and it
   allows to simply change some of the VCS parameters (most often, the branch)
   without having to redefine the complete configuration.
 * packages defined in the local source do not need to have an entry in
   overrides.yml anymore. Only proper package sets do.
 * fix env.sh update in cases of build failures
 * fix osdeps/autobuild package unification in some cases. In particular,
   autoproj will fall-back to self-built packages if an OS package is not
   provided on *this particular OS/version pair*, even though it exists for
   other OSes or other versions of the same OS.
 * in case the layout selects some packages, partial build commands should not
   forcefully select packages that are not part of the layout at all.

= Version 1.5.2
 * fix ignored_packages and exclude_packages

= Version 1.5.1
 * --no-osdeps disables updating autobuild and autoproj, as it should
 * fixed checking out modules that are not yet checked out
 
= Version 1.5.0
 * the "clean up this  mess" release. Autoproj's main logic is now properly
   split into separate methods instead of being all in a monolitic bin/autoproj
 * autoproj build does not update by default anymore. This was a behaviour
   change that was requested by quite a few users.
 * OS dependencies and normal dependencies are unified. An OS dependency will
   have priority, if one is available on the OS. Otherwise, an autoproj package
   will be searched for.
 * remote package sets have become first-class citizens. The package sets are
   still checked out in .remotes/WEIRD_NAME, but they are then symlinked to
   autoproj/remotes/package_set_name for manipulation and inspection.
 * a lot of fixes related to partial builds and partial package selections
 * fixed wrong generation of env.sh files in some cases (mostly related to
   partial builds)

= Version 1.4.4
 * really fix the bug mentioned in 1.4.3

= Version 1.4.3
 * quickfix installations that have no layouts

= Version 1.4.2
 * change the order in which package sets are considered for version control
   information in the manifest. The package set list needs now to be defined
   from the most generic to the least generic
 * define a shell script called 'ruby' in prefix/bin to call the right ruby
   interpreter. This makes the "#! /usr/bin/env ruby" she-bang line working
   on interpreters that are not called 'ruby'.
 * the package directories (prefix, srcdir, builddir, ...) can be used by other
   packages for their configuration now.

= Version 1.4.1
 * add the envsh build mode: only update env.sh
 * rebuild <package> and force-build <package> only apply by default on the
   selected packages, not on their dependencies
 * fix rebuild for Ruby packages

= Version 1.4.0
 * ruby 1.9 compatible
 * fixes w.r.t. running autoproj under a Ruby interpreter that is not called
   'ruby' (as ruby1.9.1 on Debian)
 * packages that os-depend on 'ruby' will now depend on either ruby18 or ruby19,
   depending on the ruby version used.
 * add Arch-Linux support
 * fixes w.r.t. the 'doc' mode. In particular, the documentation installation
   now follows the layout.
 * some cosmetic fixes

= Version 1.3.4
 * Improve the RubyGems support
   - a given osdeps name can refer to a mixture of RubyGems and OS packages
   - the osdeps name can be different from the RubyGems package name
 * Fix: Autobuild::Package#depends_on_os_package(name) was not taken into
   account
 * Fix: the autoproj/ directory was deleted if "autoproj switch-config" fails.
   Fix that for the common case. It can still happen if the VCS is not
   accessible.

= Version 1.3.3
 * Fix: some configuration options were not properly saved
 * Fix: env.sh was messed up by partial builds (builds where a directory and/or
   package name is specified)
 * Fix: accept subdirectories of packages as argument to builds

= Version 1.3.2
 * Fix: GEM_HOME/bin was not added to env.sh

= Version 1.3.1
 * quick-fix bootstrapping from a git repository, and the switch-config
   command

= Version 1.3.0
 * Fix limitations of using layouts. autoproj is now able to find out
   cross-layout dependencies and act accordingly.
 
= Version 1.2.6
 * Fix mail reporting

= Version 1.2.5
 * Quickfix release: fix "autoproj bootstrap VCS URL"

= Version 1.2.4
 * manage LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 * only include the values relevant to our packages in the generated env.sh,
   instead of overcrowding them with inherited values.

= Version 1.2.3
 * fix the definition of the subversion package under ubuntu/debian
 * improve selection of packages on the command line. Most glitches
   that appears when using that feature are gone now.
 * allow to give options to the VCS during boostrap, and to switch
   the source of the configuration. I.e.
     autoproj switch-config git URL branch=newbranch
   will exchange/update the configuration in autoproj/ with the specified one.
 * bugfixes

= Version 1.2.2
 * added support for Gentoo
 * added support for Ubuntu 9.10 [Karmic Koala]
 * add the 'fast-build' mode which is equivalent to 
   "build --no-update --no-osdeps"
 * add a quick bootstrap method [still experimental]
   If an autoproj installation is already present, one can simply run autoproj
   bootstrap [options]. It speeds up the bootstrapping as the gems are taken
   from the other installation.
 * minor bugfixes and improvements

= Version 1.2.1
 * accept two layouts for version control description:
   
   - package_name:
       type: git
       url: blablabla

   and

   - package_name:
     type: git
     url: blablabla

   Even though the second one is not the proper YAML data structure,
   it is actually quite intuitively written by humans, so accept it.

= Version 1.2.0
 * added the rebuild and force-build modes
 * added a local source that allows to override imported package sets and so on.
 * improved documentation on the subject of customizing the installation

= Version 1.1.3
 * fix --reconfigure on installations where the main configuration is managed by
   a VCS
 * fix: env.sh where updated on "status" or "doc", which made them invalid
 * shut up the "lsb_release: command not found" message during bootstrapping
 * fix restartig the autoproj_bootstrap script after a failed attempt

= Version 1.1.2
 * fix version detection on Debian, lsb-release cannot be trusted there.
 * update already installed Gem
 * make autoproj update himself, as well as autobuild

= Version 1.1.1
 * better general error reporting
 * small fixes w.r.t. bootstrapping
 * small improvements in the handling of layouts
 * make it easier to write osdeps scripts: the OS names and version accept lists
   as for instance:
     debian,ubuntu:
       lenny,9.04: package_to_install
 * detect Ubuntu

= Version 1.1.0
 * added some sanity checks, especially w.r.t. an already existing GEM
   installation
 * improved the bootstrap
 * autoproj is now able to track a configuration repository (i.e. a VCS that
   stores both the installation's manifest and the package sets)

= Version 1.0
 * initial release
