= Version 1.4.1
 * add the envsh build mode: only update env.sh
 * rebuild <package> and force-build <package> only apply by default on the
   selected packages, not on their dependencies
 * fix rebuild for Ruby packages

= Version 1.4.0
 * ruby 1.9 compatible
 * fixes w.r.t. running autoproj under a Ruby interpreter that is not called
   'ruby' (as ruby1.9.1 on Debian)
 * packages that os-depend on 'ruby' will now depend on either ruby18 or ruby19,
   depending on the ruby version used.
 * add Arch-Linux support
 * fixes w.r.t. the 'doc' mode. In particular, the documentation installation
   now follows the layout.
 * some cosmetic fixes

= Version 1.3.4
 * Improve the RubyGems support
   - a given osdeps name can refer to a mixture of RubyGems and OS packages
   - the osdeps name can be different from the RubyGems package name
 * Fix: Autobuild::Package#depends_on_os_package(name) was not taken into
   account
 * Fix: the autoproj/ directory was deleted if "autoproj switch-config" fails.
   Fix that for the common case. It can still happen if the VCS is not
   accessible.

= Version 1.3.3
 * Fix: some configuration options were not properly saved
 * Fix: env.sh was messed up by partial builds (builds where a directory and/or
   package name is specified)
 * Fix: accept subdirectories of packages as argument to builds

= Version 1.3.2
 * Fix: GEM_HOME/bin was not added to env.sh

= Version 1.3.1
 * quick-fix bootstrapping from a git repository, and the switch-config
   command

= Version 1.3.0
 * Fix limitations of using layouts. autoproj is now able to find out
   cross-layout dependencies and act accordingly.
 
= Version 1.2.6
 * Fix mail reporting

= Version 1.2.5
 * Quickfix release: fix "autoproj bootstrap VCS URL"

= Version 1.2.4
 * manage LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 * only include the values relevant to our packages in the generated env.sh,
   instead of overcrowding them with inherited values.

= Version 1.2.3
 * fix the definition of the subversion package under ubuntu/debian
 * improve selection of packages on the command line. Most glitches
   that appears when using that feature are gone now.
 * allow to give options to the VCS during boostrap, and to switch
   the source of the configuration. I.e.
     autoproj switch-config git URL branch=newbranch
   will exchange/update the configuration in autoproj/ with the specified one.
 * bugfixes

= Version 1.2.2
 * added support for Gentoo
 * added support for Ubuntu 9.10 [Karmic Koala]
 * add the 'fast-build' mode which is equivalent to 
   "build --no-update --no-osdeps"
 * add a quick bootstrap method [still experimental]
   If an autoproj installation is already present, one can simply run autoproj
   bootstrap [options]. It speeds up the bootstrapping as the gems are taken
   from the other installation.
 * minor bugfixes and improvements

= Version 1.2.1
 * accept two layouts for version control description:
   
   - package_name:
       type: git
       url: blablabla

   and

   - package_name:
     type: git
     url: blablabla

   Even though the second one is not the proper YAML data structure,
   it is actually quite intuitively written by humans, so accept it.

= Version 1.2.0
 * added the rebuild and force-build modes
 * added a local source that allows to override imported package sets and so on.
 * improved documentation on the subject of customizing the installation

= Version 1.1.3
 * fix --reconfigure on installations where the main configuration is managed by
   a VCS
 * fix: env.sh where updated on "status" or "doc", which made them invalid
 * shut up the "lsb_release: command not found" message during bootstrapping
 * fix restartig the autoproj_bootstrap script after a failed attempt

= Version 1.1.2
 * fix version detection on Debian, lsb-release cannot be trusted there.
 * update already installed Gem
 * make autoproj update himself, as well as autobuild

= Version 1.1.1
 * better general error reporting
 * small fixes w.r.t. bootstrapping
 * small improvements in the handling of layouts
 * make it easier to write osdeps scripts: the OS names and version accept lists
   as for instance:
     debian,ubuntu:
       lenny,9.04: package_to_install
 * detect Ubuntu

= Version 1.1.0
 * added some sanity checks, especially w.r.t. an already existing GEM
   installation
 * improved the bootstrap
 * autoproj is now able to track a configuration repository (i.e. a VCS that
   stores both the installation's manifest and the package sets)

= Version 1.0
 * initial release
