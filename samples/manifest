package_sets:
# Example from the RubyInMotion orocos package set
#   - type: git
#     url: git://github.com/doudou/rubim.orocos.git

# If you want to adapt the layout to your needs, uncomment the following (again,
# RubyInMotion orocos package set)
# layout:
#   - orocos:
#     - rubim.orocos
#
# The principle is to have a hierarchy of names, package names and names of
# package sets. In the above example, all packages of the rubim.orocos package
# set will be built under the orocos/ subdirectory. Alternatively, you could do:
#
# layout:
#   - tools:
#     - rubim.orocos
